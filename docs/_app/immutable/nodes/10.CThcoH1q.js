Welcome to the era of ephemeral, automated TLS.</p> <h2>7-Day and 1-Hour Certificates</h2> <p>Google, Cloudflare, and Netflix already use certificates valid for days — or even hours. Shorter = safer. Compromised keys have no time to be exploited.</p> <h2>ACME 2.0 and Beyond</h2> <p>The ACME protocol now supports wildcard renewals, multi-SAN, and account binding. Full automation is finally reliable at scale.</p> <h2>Zero-Downtime Renewals</h2> <p>Modern load balancers (NGINX, Traefik, Caddy) hot-reload certificates without dropping connections. Users never see a blip.</p> <h2>AI-Powered Certificate Management</h2> <p>Emerging tools predict renewal failures, detect rogue certificates, and auto-remediate — before humans even notice.</p> <blockquote class="border-start border-warning border-4 ps-4 py-3 my-5"><strong>Prediction:</strong> By 2028, 90% of certificates will be issued and renewed without human intervention.</blockquote> <h2>Your Move</h2> <p>Start today with free tools like <strong>AxelBase SSL Checker</strong> to audit your current state. Then automate everything.</p> <p>The future isn’t coming — it’s already here.</p> <p class="italic-note">Be part of it. Start checking.
