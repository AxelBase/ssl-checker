Immediate Revenue Loss</h2> <p>E-commerce sites lose <strong>up to 80% of conversions</strong> when SSL errors appear. A 2024 study showed an average cart abandonment rate of 87% during certificate outages.</p> <h2>2. SEO Ranking Drop</h2> <p>Google treats expired certificates like HTTP — demoting your site in search results. Recovery can take weeks, even after fixing the issue.</p> <h2>3. Brand Damage</h2> <p>Users see “Not Secure” and assume your site is hacked or untrustworthy. That perception lingers long after the certificate is renewed.</p> <h2>Real Case Studies</h2> <ul><li>A UK retailer lost £47,000 in one weekend</li> <li>A SaaS company dropped from page 1 to page 4 overnight</li> <li>A nonprofit saw donation form submissions fall 92%</li></ul> <blockquote class="border-start border-warning border-4 ps-4 py-3 my-5"><strong>Bottom Line:</strong> The average cost of a single SSL expiry incident in 2025 is $12,000–$150,000 depending on business size.</blockquote> <h2>Prevention Is Cheaper Than Cure</h2> <p>Free tools like <strong>AxelBase SSL Checker</strong> let you verify any domain instantly. Combine with automation and monitoring — and expiry becomes impossible.</p> <p>Don’t let a 2-minute fix cost you thousands.</p> <p class="italic-note">Check your most important domains right now — it’s free.</p></article></div>');function E(d){var e=w();S("1al8b51",u=>{var o=x(),g=h(f(o),6);t(4),s(()=>p(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),v(()=>{y.title="The Hidden Cost of Expired SSL Certificates | AxelBase Blog"}),r(u,o)});var a=i(e),m=i(a);t(4),n(a),t(2),n(e),s(()=>p(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),r(d,e)}export{E as component,B as universal};
