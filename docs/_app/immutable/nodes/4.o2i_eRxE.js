Browsers, search engines, and users have zero tolerance for expired or invalid certificates.</p> <h2>Browser Warnings Are Brutal</h2> <p>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari now display full-page interstitial warnings for expired certificates. Users see “Your connection is not private” or “NET::ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID” — and most will leave immediately. Studies show <strong>over 85% of users abandon sites</strong> with SSL errors.</p> <h2>Google Penalizes Non-HTTPS Sites</h2> <p>Since 2018, Google has used HTTPS as a ranking signal. In 2025, it’s one of the strongest lightweight ranking factors. Sites with expired certificates are treated the same as HTTP sites — pushed down in search results.</p> <h2>Mixed Content Breaks Everything</h2> <p>Modern browsers block mixed content by default. An expired certificate causes images, CSS, JavaScript, and fonts to fail loading — turning your site into a broken mess even if the HTML loads.</p> <h2>Real-World Consequences</h2> <ul><li>Lost revenue from abandoned checkouts</li> <li>Damaged brand reputation</li> <li>SEO rankings drop overnight</li> <li>Security teams flagged in audits</li></ul> <blockquote class="border-start border-warning border-4 ps-4 py-3 my-5"><strong>Fact:</strong> In 2024, over 1.2 million websites went offline temporarily due to expired certificates — many lost thousands in revenue.</blockquote> <h2>The Solution: Proactive Monitoring</h2> <p>Tools like <strong>AxelBase SSL Checker</strong> help you stay ahead by instantly verifying certificate status for any domain — completely in-browser, with zero data sent to servers.</p> <p>Never let an expired certificate catch you off guard again.</p> <p class="italic-note">Start checking your domains today — it takes 2 seconds.</p></article></div>');function E(p){var e=_();y("1tq17n3",f=>{var a=w(),m=u(h(a),6);t(8),o(()=>l(m,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),S(()=>{v.title="Why SSL Certificates Matter in 2025 | AxelBase Blog"}),i(f,a)});var r=n(e),g=n(r);t(4),s(r),t(2),s(e),o(()=>l(g,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(p,e)}export{E as component,B as universal};
